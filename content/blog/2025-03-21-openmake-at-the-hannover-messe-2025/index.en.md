Next week, starting 31.05.2025, we will be one week in Hannover for the
Hannover Messe. The Messe is quite famous (the. "world leading
industryshow") in the world of the manufacturing industry. [We will
represent](https://www.hannovermesse.de/exhibitor/tu-berlin-university-alliance/N1579275?editor=visitorView&exhibitor=77sbexz9&tdom-loc=xz532fiw&scene-node=qdlmca3k)
both the OpenMake project (implementing open and fair hardware) and the
[LAUDS Factories](https://lauds.eu) (local accessible urban digital
sustainable factories).

![We present 4 products at the Messe: the BUA mobile lab, OSH tools
(documentation template and review system), urban manufacturing
challenges (lauds factories), and the Mekanika open source CNC
machine](images/Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 10.09.58.png)

We will present [our mobile
lab](https://www.hannovermesse.de/product/bua-mobile-lab/459128/N1579275),
including open source CNC mills developed by our lauds partner
[Mekanika](https://www.hannovermesse.de/product/mekanika-open-source-cnc-machines/459127/N1579275),
and the beta version of our hardware review and publication system.

Our goal is to get in contact with the industry to get insights on the
role open source hardware and makerspaces may take in the future of the
industry, or the "future of value addition", as framed by the BMBF, who
will also be [present at the
Messe](https://www.hannovermesse.de/exhibitor/bundesministerium-bildung-u-forschung/N1482686?editor=visitorView&scene-node=qdlmca3k&exhibitor=1wtbizk1&tdom-loc=swvq8667).

We will also have [a presentation on the Tech Transfer
Stage](https://www.hannovermesse.de/event/hardware-documentation-best-practices-to-foster-open-innovation/vor/8349),
where we will present the role of good documentation for efficient
collaboration, to "break silos and empower diverse contributors" and
discuss the role of collaborative work  
inside companies, between different (and usually competitive) companies,
and between universities and the industry.

We are looking forward to take this challenge. Do not hesitate to stop
by our stands if you are going to Hannover: **Hall 2, Stand C14**
