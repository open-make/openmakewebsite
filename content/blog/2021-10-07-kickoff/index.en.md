## Proceedings

### Introductions

Originally planned as fully in-person, the kickoff meeting had to be shifted to
a hybrid meeting, due to unforseen circumstances. After those who could attend
in person had arrived - and everyone else joined virtually, Julien Colomb
officially kicked things off with giving an overview of the project, its
intended timeline, and what has been done so far.

### Host Labs

This was followed by the three cooperating labs presenting themselves,
especially what their respective skillset encompasses and how their interests
align with the project:

First to speak was Prof. Tim Landgraf (FUB), who spoke on behavioral research
with a focus on machine learning and robotics. This was followed by Prof Mathew
Larkum (HUB), who talked about SFB 1315[^1] and the Dendrite Hypothesis. Closing
this round of presentations was Prof. Roland Jochem (TUB), who detailed his labs
works in industrial machining and factory management.

### Use cases I

The next series of talks - with one intermission - were about specific use cases
for Open.Make: Starting these of was Julien once more, this time presenting the
details of the Air-Track system [^2] and how being open has already enabled 8
labs to incorporate it and co-develop further.

### Berlin University Alliance

Before everyone headed into a break, Stefan Skupien gave an overview of the
BUA's work and what their expectations were for the project. In particular, the
main question for them was _what results can they take from this project in 18
months and apply to the rest of the BUA_?

### Use cases II

After everyone had returned from the break, the following talk was given by
Moritz Maxeiner, who spoke on the RoboFish system[^3] and the Electrofish
project in particular, where open hardware components are being developed. These
talks were then closed off by Lukas Winter, who recounted in-depth his
experience - including the challenges - in developing an open imaging MR system
that, for certain use cases, can hold its own against significantly more
expensive proprietary systems.

### Related projects

In the last segment, there were three presentations of projects thematically
related to Open.Make: Dietrich Jaeger started by giving an overview of the Open
Hardware Observatory[^4], a non-profit organization that tries to make open
hardware projects more easily accessible and assessable. Following that, York
Winter spoke about three companies of his - LabMaker GmbH, PhenoSys GmbH, and
Apprendis UG - each of which are interfacing with the open hardware community;
LabMaker in particular is specialized in assembling and distributing open
hardware designs. The last talk was given by Robert Mies, where he gave an
in-depth summary of the Open Hardware Ecosystem.

### Discussion

Once the talks and the meeting had officially concluded, people remained for a
while longer to exchange and discuss ideas, as well as clear up any remaining
questions.
