We had our first progress report with the professors last week.
We used this two hours window to present the new team members, and our progresses, successes and failures.
Here is a short summary of our presentations and discussions.
We started by using some extract of the interviews to illustrate the main issues we tackle,
that is the discrepancy between 
(1) the importance of open source hardware for science and society, and
(2) the absence of personal incentives for the creation of documentation required.

In order to design an hardware publication platform, we want to look on one hand, at current practices and tools to set the practicality of the tool, 
and on the other hand, define the theoretical objectives, that the community would see fulfill.
This latter point is also working on the preparation of outreach for our work in the community.

# Research: interviews and ethnographic study

We presented the preparatory work done in order to organise interviews and ethnographic studies, 
which will help us understand the current (best) practice in hardware documentation and sharing, by researching what people say about their work, and how they work, respectively.

Interview: 
- Two test interviews were run (blog posts will probably follow)
- The list of questions was  finalised.
- A list of project was created and a subset were chosen.
- For this short-list, connected researchers were contacted.
Ethnographic study:
- Two methods tested on Mortiz workflow (daily lab journal versus intermittent work diary) 
- Time intensive job for the researcher
- Starting to contact external researhers


# Outreach: community building and the RDA 

We thrived the creation of a RDA group about OSH and the definition of FAIR hardware.
With this work, we are trying to build a community around the definition of 
good practices for research hardware development and publication.
The charter of the group is in revision, while the group is already working on the 
definition of `research hardware`. 
By chairing this group, open make is actively participating in this effort.

We are very grateful for all the connections we achieved through the RDA group,
and are confident that the work done inside the RDA will have a large repercussion
on the reasearch hadware ecosystem, as well as in the industry and its legislation.



# Conclusions

Our next meeting will be in September/october this year.
Until then, we need to continue our work to get the first analyses of the interviews
and some insights into FAIR definitions for hardware.
This will allow us to discuss our next steps, especially the hardare publication platform and a guidance system for reasearchers (book, choice software,...).
In addition, that meeting will see discussion about the creation of follow up projects.
