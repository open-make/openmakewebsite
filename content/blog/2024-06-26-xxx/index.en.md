BUA Mobile Lab at Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften: An Open-Source Hardware

Hello, esteemed readers! We are thrilled to share that we presented the BUA Mobile Lab at the Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften 2024 at Technische Universität Berlin. This pioneering initiative by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) – a collaboration between Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin – brought cutting-edge open-source hardware directly to the public, making science accessible and engaging for all.


The Story of BUA Mobile Lab

The BUA Mobile Lab began as a vision to bridge the gap between academic research and public engagement. Inspired by the collaborative spirit of the Berlin University Alliance, our goal is to utilise the machines that were recently developed, promote technology and support open-source hardware community


Bringing Open-Source Hardware to Life

At the Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften , the Open-Source Hardware Machines of BUA Mobile Lab which were assembled by us were exhibited such as CNC milling machine from Mekanika was assembled at our Production Technology Center , Fabulaser Mini laser cutting machine from InMachines was assembled in their workshop and 3D Printer with both the operational and construction instructions freely available to the public. These machines, built on open-source principles, provided the idea behind the concept of open-source hardware and our vision of supporting students and researchers at BUA partner institutions in Berlin.


Highlights of the Event

We were excited to assist attendees in explaining them about the machines and turning their hardware ideas into tangible prototypes. Visitors had the unique opportunity to view our open-source hardware machines, demonstrating a fully transparent tool chain from initial concept to final product.The laser cut personalized bookmarks gained attraction among the visitors.


Successful Projects

Throughout the event, we showcased several projects that illustrated the power and versatility of open-source hardware machines which created interest by visitors and had positive response

Customized Bookmarks: Leveraging the precision of the Fabulaser Mini, we created personalized bookmarks from recycled paper for visitors, showcasing the creative potential of laser cutting technology.

MNTRE Keyboard: The keyboard, sourced from the open-source company MNT Reform, featured a casing manufactured by students using our CNC milling machine. This project illustrated how the BUA Mobile Lab facilitates the design and creation of intricate components, empowering students’ and researchers .

Screen Printing Workshop: During the event, pupils gathered to develop an open-source screen printing machine from Mekanika. The purpose of this workshop was to demonstrate how we successfully replicated the machines and encourage similar achievements at LNDW.


Get Support to Publish Your Hardware


In addition to providing hands-on access to advanced hardware, the BUA Mobile Lab offers comprehensive support for all creators looking to review and publish their hardware design projects. We will assist you in documenting your project, securing appropriate licenses, and support in technical drawings etc. Our platform will ensure that your innovations are shared with the community which can further help in foster collaboration.

We extend our sincere gratitude to all the visitors, and supporters who contributed in making this event a memorable journey.Stay tuned for more updates from the BUA Mobile Lab as we are excited about our next steps.
