* BUA Mobile Lab at Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften: An Open-Source Hardware

Hello, dear visitors.Long Night of Science is an annual event in Germany where universities and research institutions showcase scientific demonstrations, lectures, and interactive activities, making science accessible and engaging for all ages. We want to share that we presented the BUA Mobile Lab at the LOng Night of Science 2024 at Technische Universität Berlin. This initiative by the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) – a collaboration between Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin – brought cutting-edge open-source hardware directly to the public, making science accessible and engaging for all.


* The Story of BUA Mobile Lab

The BUA Mobile Lab began as a vision to bridge the gap between academic research and public engagement. Inspired by the collaborative spirit of the Berlin University Alliance, our goal is to utilise the machines that were recently developed, promote technology and support open-source hardware community

* Bringing Open-Source Hardware to Life

At the Long Night of Science, Open-Source Hardware Machines of BUA Mobile Lab which were assembled by us were exhibited such as CNC milling machine from Mekanika was assembled at our Production Technology Center, Fabulaser Mini laser cutting machine from InMachines was assembled in their workshop and 3D Printer with both the operational and construction instructions freely available to the public. These machines, built on open-source principles, provided the idea behind the concept of open-source hardware and our vision of supporting students and researchers at BUA partner institutions in Berlin.


* Highlights of the Event

We were excited to assist attendees in explaining them about the machines and turning their hardware ideas into tangible prototypes. Visitors had the unique opportunity to view our open-source hardware machines, demonstrating a fully transparent tool chain from initial concept to final product.The laser cut personalized bookmarks gained attraction among the visitors.

Successful Projects

Throughout the event, we showcased several projects that illustrated the power and versatility of open-source hardware machines which created interest by visitors and had positive response

Customized Bookmarks: Leveraging the precision of the Fabulaser Mini, we created personalized bookmarks from recycled paper for visitors, showcasing the creative potential of laser cutting technology.

MNTRE Keyboard: The keyboard, sourced from the open-source company MNT Reform, featured a casing manufactured by students using our CNC milling machine. This project illustrated how the BUA Mobile Lab facilitates the design and creation of intricate components, empowering students’ and researchers .
