Berlin researchers can now access a central lab and a mobile lab to design and produce research hardware.
The BUA mobile lab is on tour, with a first stop at the FU Berlin.

# Dear Berlin researchers,

Have you ever heard of makerspaces, 3d printing, or open source research hardware?  
You may wonder how these concepts are connected with open science and research reproducibility.
Whether you are developing, building or using hardware in your research, or are just curious about makerspaces and digital production technologies, make sure you visit the [Making Lab](/makinglab/) or the [BUA Mobile Lab](/mobilelab/) on tour !
The Open.Make team will answer your questions and collect your ideas.

The Mobile lab is staying at the **FU mensa II from 02/06 to 13/06/2025**, the team will be there every workday around lunch time and on request ([Contact us](/contact/) !).

The interdisciplinary team of the BUA Open.make project (a project of the Berlin University Alliance, which aims at implementing open and FAIR research hardware in Berlin Universities) has been creating the [BUA mobile lab](/mobilelab/) to provide space and mentoring to BUA hardware developers and makers.
In a trailer setup, we put together a set of different digital production machines to demonstrate the possibilities available in a makerspace.
On top of demonstrating the technical and social assets of makerspaces, we want to run real research hardware project: We aim to provide mentoring on digital production and project documentation for **your research hardware project**.
Both the Mobile Lab and its immobile pendant based at the TU library (the [Making Lab](/makinglab/)) can be accessed following the same access [rules](https://www.tu.berlin/en/qw/ueber-uns/einrichtungen/making-lab) and [code of conduct](https://codeberg.org/jcolomb/Labs-codeOfConduct/src/branch/main/codeofconduct.md).
University project will be mentored on the use of the machines and the documentation of their work, via the work of an hardware research engineer.

Whether you like or dislike the idea, we will be happy to receive your feedback and see how we can better fit our service to your needs.
We look forward to talk to you at the Mensa II of the FU Berlin!
