During the Hannover Messe 2025,
we realised our academic research is fully relevant for the industry.
We  indeed talked to several experienced engineers and managers
about how documentation and open collaborative work 
can strive open source hardware development.
They listened carefully, mentioning the industry too, needs more 
cooperation and communication.

## Five days at the Hannover Messe

The Messe is five days long, and we are still quite tired, while writing this post.
The world of the industry is quite different from the academic conference,
as most people are there to build business connection, sell or buy products.
We were in the hall dedicated to future technologies and research,
which had its own flair.
Each evening had its party, with live music, free drinks and free food.
Canada was the host country and the party they organised was pretty crazy.

We went there with our mobile lab to present our work on OSH inside openmake and inside the LAUDS Factory project.
We had a visit from the XXX of Berlin on Monday (Fig. 1), and had a talk on Thursday. 
In general, we spend most of our time talking to people, both presenting our work
and collecting data on the different subjects defined before the Messe. 
We also drank a lot of coffee, while both food and drinks were organised
by the GREAT TUBs team (thanks again to all of you !)

### Highlights

We come back from Hannover with the impression what we do is useful, 
and we should continue doing it. 
Understanding how collaborative work can be organised,
is a valuable input not only for researchers but also for the industry,
which face very similar problems. We come with solutions to 
a problem that older engineers had faced for years.

As a direct input, we will start a collaboration with the transfer office, 
as they want to implement a hardware documentation review for all patents, 
as they realized most patents filed are unusable once the people leave the university.
