The mobile lab is a trailer equipped with manufacturing tools.
It will be parked at different location in the campus and on conferences to 
demonstrate the value of collaborative and inclusive work in 
hardware development projects.

It is equipped with a CNC milling machine, a laser cutter, and a 3D printer.

Provided a 7x3m space and electricity, it can be used to build hardware prototypes.
It can also be seen as an extension of the Making lab:
students and researchers can use this infrastructure, 
under the supervision of the Open.Make team, and the [code of conduct](https://codeberg.org/jcolomb/Labs-codeOfConduct/src/branch/main/codeofconduct.md) applies.

Mobile lab locations:

- Gitex europe (Mai 2025)
- FU location is summer 2025
- Fab25 in Prag in July 2025
- HU/Charité campus in autumn 2025
