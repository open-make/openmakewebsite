The Making Lab is located in the Central Library of the TU/UdK and is an infrastructure
run in collaboration between the library and the Open.Make project.
It aims at teaching and demonstrating the value of collaborative and inclusive work in 
hardware development projects. 

It was opened on the 28th of April 2025. Since then, 
it is a place For all Berlin researchers to access
manufacturing tools like a CNC milling machine, a laser cutter, 3D printers and various metal and woodworking tools
, a place to **learn to make** under the mentoring of the Open.Make team.
A special focus is given to the production and
publication of hardware documentation.



The room is an inclusive space 
and a specific [code of conduct](https://codeberg.org/jcolomb/Labs-codeOfConduct/src/branch/main/codeofconduct.md) is being implemented.

Official rules for usage can be accessed at
