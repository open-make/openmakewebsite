The Making Lab is located in the Central Library of the TU/UdK and is an infrastructure
run in collaboration between the library and the Open.Make project.
It aims at teaching and demonstrating the value of collaborative and inclusive work in 
hardware development projects. 

It was opened on the 28th of April 2025. Since then, 
it is a place For all Berlin researchers to access manufacturing tools like a CNC mill,
a laser cutter, and diverse woodwork tools,
and **learn to make** under the mentoring of the Open.Make team.
A special focus is given to the production and
publication of hardware documentation.
