## Let's work together !

The Open.Make project is collaborating with different projects and community
in order to achieve its goal. 
If you think you have similar or complementary objectives, 
do not hesitate to [contact us](https://github.com/open-make/open.make-mainrepo/issues/new?assignees=jcolomb&labels=externalquestion&template=first-contact.md&title=%5Bcontact%5D) and let's start collaborating.


We have been approaching several related communities,
initiatives and projects:

We are also actively participating in the community.
